# System Environment Mismatch - Solutions

If the same app with the same login credentials works on your computer but not on your colleague's, there are several environment-specific factors that could be causing this:

## 1. Network/Security Differences

### Corporate Network Policies
Your colleague's corporate network might:
- Be performing SSL interception (man-in-the-middle inspection)
- Have URL filtering that allows connections but blocks specific content
- Apply different security rules to API calls vs. browser requests

**Solution:**
- Have your colleague's IT department add exceptions for the app/domain
- Try the app on a different network (e.g., personal mobile hotspot)

### Proxy Settings
Your colleague's machine might be using a proxy server:
- Windows proxy settings might affect requests
- The app doesn't include proxy configuration

**Solution:**
- Configure system-wide proxy settings to allow the domain
- Add explicit proxy configuration to the app

## 2. Authentication Differences

### Saved/Cached Tokens
Your app might be using saved authentication tokens:
- If you saved your credentials with "Remember Me"
- If there's local token caching

**Solution:**
- Clear all saved credentials on your system and test fresh login
- Transfer saved credential files to your colleague's system:
  ```
  # Location of QSettings saved credentials
  %APPDATA%\MyCompany\BrainLinkApp.ini
  ```

### Regional/IP Restrictions
The server might have regional or IP restrictions:
- Different geographic regions might be allowed/denied
- Some IP ranges might be whitelisted/blacklisted

**Solution:**
- Check if your colleague can access the service through a browser
- Try with a VPN to match your geographic location

## 3. Client-Side Security Software

### Anti-virus/Firewall Behavior
Security software might allow connections but block data:
- Deep packet inspection might block specific content
- Heuristic detection might block behavior patterns

**Solution:**
- Temporarily disable security software for testing
- Add specific exceptions for the application

### System Certificates
Certificate trust issues may cause validation failures:
- Windows certificate store differences
- Corporate certificate policy restrictions

**Solution:**
- Update Windows root certificates
- Export your certificate store and import on your colleague's machine:
  ```powershell
  # Export your certificate store
  Export-Certificate -Cert (Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\) -FilePath root_certs.p7b
  ```

## 4. Technical Differences

### Clock Synchronization
Time-based authentication can fail if clocks are out of sync:
- JWT tokens often use time-based validation
- OAuth flows may check timestamp validity

**Solution:**
- Ensure your colleague's system clock is synchronized:
  ```powershell
  # Check time sync status
  w32tm /query /status
  
  # Force time sync
  w32tm /resync /force
  ```

### API Throttling/Rate Limiting
Your colleague might be experiencing rate limiting:
- IP-based rate limits might be different
- Failed login attempts might trigger temporary blocking

**Solution:**
- Wait 30 minutes and try again
- Check for "too many attempts" messages in the response

## Next Steps

To help diagnose which of these issues is affecting your colleague:

1. **Export your working settings**:
   ```powershell
   reg export "HKCU\Software\MyCompany" settings.reg
   ```

2. **Create a detailed comparison**:
   Have your colleague run these commands and send you the results:
   ```powershell
   # System info
   systeminfo > systeminfo.txt
   
   # Network configuration
   ipconfig /all > network.txt
   
   # Proxy settings
   netsh winhttp show proxy > proxy.txt
   
   # Time settings
   w32tm /query /status > time.txt
   ```

3. **Test with a more basic client**:
   Create a simple script that just tries to authenticate:
   ```powershell
   # Run this test script
   python -c "import requests; print(requests.post('https://en.mindspeller.com/api/cas/token/login', json={'username':'test_user', 'password':'test_pass'}, headers={'Content-Type':'application/json'}).text)"
   ```
