# UI Update and BLE Connection Stability Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **Dashboard UI not updating**: Values changing in logs but UI not reflecting changes
2. **BLE device disconnecting**: Connection dropping after a few seconds

## Fixes Applied

### 1. UI Update Debugging and Fixes

#### Added Debug Logging to BandPowerDisplay Component
- Added render count tracking to verify component re-renders
- Added console logging when new props are received
- Added visual indicators (render count and timestamp) to the UI

#### Enhanced State Management in DashboardScreen
- Added detailed logging when setting new band powers
- Added timestamp (`lastUpdate`) to bandPowers object to force React re-renders
- Added validation logging to confirm state changes

#### Code Changes
```javascript
// BandPowerDisplay.js
const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = React.useState(0);
React.useEffect(() => {
  setRenderCount(prev => prev + 1);
  console.log('üé® BandPowerDisplay received new bandPowers:', {...});
}, [bandPowers]);

// DashboardScreen.js  
const newBandPowers = {
  // ...existing properties...
  lastUpdate: Date.now(), // Force React to detect changes
};
console.log('üîÑ Setting new band powers:', {...});
setBandPowers(newBandPowers);
```

### 2. BLE Connection Stability Improvements

#### Added Connection Monitoring
- Implemented periodic connection health checks (every 5 seconds)
- Added connection monitor timer to detect silent disconnections
- Enhanced disconnection handling with proper cleanup

#### Improved Command Sending
- Changed command sending to prefer `writeWithoutResponse` over `writeWithResponse`
- Added connection validation before sending commands
- Added better error handling for disconnection scenarios

#### Enhanced Disconnection Detection
- Added more detailed disconnect error logging
- Improved cleanup when disconnections are detected
- Added connection monitoring start/stop on connect/disconnect

#### Code Changes
```javascript
// BluetoothService.js
startConnectionMonitoring() {
  this.connectionMonitor = setInterval(async () => {
    if (this.connectedDevice && this.isConnected) {
      const isConnected = await this.connectedDevice.isConnected();
      if (!isConnected) {
        this.handleDeviceDisconnection();
      }
    }
  }, 5000);
}

// Improved command sending
if (characteristic.isWritableWithoutResponse) {
  await characteristic.writeWithoutResponse(commandData);
} else if (characteristic.isWritableWithResponse) {
  await characteristic.writeWithResponse(commandData);
}
```

## Debugging Features Added

### Visual Indicators
- Render count in UI title: "EEG Analysis (Updates: X)"
- Last update timestamp displayed below title
- Console logging for all state changes

### Connection Monitoring
- Connection health checks every 5 seconds
- Detailed disconnect reason logging
- Connection monitor lifecycle management

## Testing Instructions

1. **UI Update Testing**:
   - Connect to BrainLink device
   - Watch for "Updates: X" counter in UI title
   - Check console logs for "üé® BandPowerDisplay received new bandPowers"
   - Verify timestamp updates in UI

2. **Connection Stability Testing**:
   - Connect to device and monitor for 60+ seconds
   - Check console for connection monitor messages
   - Look for "üîç Connection monitoring started" message
   - Monitor for unexpected disconnections

## Expected Behavior

### UI Updates
- Render count should increment with each EEG data processing cycle
- Timestamp should update continuously when data is flowing
- Console should show regular "üé® BandPowerDisplay received new bandPowers" messages

### Connection Stability
- Device should remain connected for extended periods
- Connection monitor should run every 5 seconds
- Any disconnections should be properly detected and handled
- Console should show "üîç Connection monitoring started" on connect

## Troubleshooting

### If UI Still Not Updating
1. Check console for "üîÑ Setting new band powers" messages
2. Verify "üé® BandPowerDisplay received new bandPowers" messages
3. Check if render count is incrementing
4. Verify timestamp is updating

### If Connection Still Dropping
1. Check console for detailed disconnect reasons
2. Look for connection monitor error messages
3. Verify if command sending is causing disconnections
4. Monitor timing between connection and first disconnect

## Files Modified
- `components/BandPowerDisplay.js` - Added debug logging and visual indicators
- `screens/DashboardScreen.js` - Enhanced state management and logging
- `services/BluetoothService.js` - Added connection monitoring and improved command handling
