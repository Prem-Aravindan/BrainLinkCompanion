Instructions Overview:
Calibration consists of two 30-second phases:
1. Eyes Closed Phase (30 seconds)
2. Eyes Open Phase (30 seconds)

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Calibration Dialog Initial State]

Phase 1: Eyes Closed Calibration
---------------------------------

Preparation:
1. View dialog title: "Baseline Calibration"
2. Read subtitle: "Step 6 of 8: Establish your baseline brain activity"
3. Read the instructions carefully:
   "We will record your baseline brain activity in two phases:
    1. Eyes Closed (30s): Close your eyes and relax
    2. Eyes Open (30s): Keep eyes open, stay relaxed
    
    Click 'Start Eyes Closed' to begin."

Starting Eyes Closed Phase:
1. Get comfortable in your seat
2. Minimize body movement
3. Click "Start Eyes Closed (30s)" button
4. Immediately close your eyes

During Eyes Closed Recording (30 seconds):
- Keep your eyes gently closed
- Relax your facial muscles
- Breathe naturally and calmly
- Avoid swallowing or jaw movement
- Do not fall asleep - remain awake and relaxed
- Status shows: "Recording: Eyes Closed"
- Message: "Close your eyes and relax... (30 seconds)"
- Timer automatically counts down

Progress Indicators:
- Real-time data collection happening in background
- Console shows: "✅ EC Progress: X windows kept, Y rejected"
- Signal quality continuously monitored
- Poor quality segments automatically rejected

What Happens After 30 Seconds:
- Recording stops automatically
- Status updates to: "✓ Eyes Closed Complete"
- Message: "Phase 1 complete. Ready for phase 2."
- "Start Eyes Open (30s)" button becomes enabled

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Eyes Closed Recording in Progress]

Phase 2: Eyes Open Calibration
-------------------------------

Preparation:
1. Take a brief moment to prepare (5-10 seconds)
2. You may blink naturally
3. When ready, click "Start Eyes Open (30s)" button

During Eyes Open Recording (30 seconds):
- Keep your eyes open and relaxed
- Look at a fixed point in front of you (center of screen)
- Blink naturally - don't try to suppress blinking
- Keep your head still
- Maintain relaxed posture
- Breathe calmly
- Status shows: "Recording: Eyes Open"
- Message: "Keep your eyes open and stay relaxed... (30 seconds)"
- Timer automatically counts down

Progress Indicators:
- Similar to eyes closed phase
- Console shows: "✅ EO Progress: X windows kept, Y rejected"
- Both phases now contributing to baseline

What Happens After 30 Seconds:
- Recording stops automatically
- Status updates to: "✓ Calibration Complete"
- Message: "Both phases complete. Computing baseline statistics..."
- Application computes baseline statistics automatically
- "Next →" button becomes enabled

[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Eyes Open Recording in Progress]

Baseline Statistics Computation:
- Average power in different frequency bands calculated
- Reference values established for:
  * Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz) - deep relaxation
  * Theta waves (4-8 Hz) - drowsiness, meditation
  * Alpha waves (8-13 Hz) - relaxed awareness
  * Beta waves (13-30 Hz) - active thinking
  * Gamma waves (30-50 Hz) - high-level processing
- Baseline median and scale factors computed
- Results stored for comparison with task data

Calibration Quality:
Good Calibration Indicators:
- Most data windows accepted (> 90%)
- Stable signal throughout both phases
- No error messages or rejections
- Smooth completion of both phases

Poor Calibration Indicators:
- Many rejected windows (< 70% accepted)
- Warning messages about signal quality
- Excessive movement or artifacts

If Calibration Quality is Poor:
- You may navigate back and repeat calibration
- Ensure better electrode contact
- Minimize movement and muscle tension
- Try to relax more fully

Navigation:
- Click "← Back" to return to pathway selection (if you want to redo)
- Click "Next →" to proceed to task selection (after successful calibration)

Important Notes:
- Calibration is crucial for accurate analysis
- Take your time to get good quality recordings
- If interrupted, you can restart the phase
- Both phases must be completed to proceed
