# BrainLink Device Connection and Button Stability Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Device Disconnects After Few Seconds
**Problem**: BrainLink device was disconnecting unexpectedly after a few seconds of connection.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Connection Monitoring**: Improved connection monitoring with 3-second intervals instead of 5 seconds
- **Keep-Alive Mechanism**: Added automatic keep-alive commands every 3 seconds to maintain connection
- **Connection Timeout**: Reduced connection timeout from 15s to 10s for faster failure detection
- **Data Timeout Detection**: Added 10-second data timeout monitoring to detect when device stops sending data
- **Automatic Recovery**: Device automatically restarts streaming if data flow stops
- **Graceful Disconnect Handling**: Added 500ms delay before triggering disconnect handlers to prevent race conditions

### 2. Inactive/Stuck Buttons
**Problem**: Buttons (Connect, Disconnect, Start/Stop Recording) were becoming inactive and unresponsive.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Periodic Button State Reset**: Added automatic button state reset every 5 seconds when disconnected
- **Multiple State Reset Attempts**: Added multiple delayed state resets (100ms and 1000ms) after disconnect
- **Force State Cleanup**: Enhanced disconnect handler to clear all button loading states
- **Connection Status Listener**: Improved connection status listener to properly reset all states

### 3. Constant Data Issues
**Problem**: Device was sending constant dummy data (-3499.00 ÂµV) instead of real EEG signals.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Faster Alternative Commands**: Reduced constant data detection interval from every 20 to every 10 detections
- **Device Reset Sequence**: Added comprehensive device reset after 50 constant data detections
- **Binary Reset Commands**: Added binary reset commands to try forcing device out of test mode
- **Advanced Recovery**: Multiple reset strategies including STOP, RESET, INIT, RESTART commands

## Technical Improvements

### Connection Stability
```javascript
// Keep-alive mechanism
async sendKeepAlive() {
  const keepAliveCommand = Buffer.from([0xAA, 0xAA, 0x02, 0x00, 0x02, 0x51, 0x51]).toString('base64');
  await this.commandCharacteristic.writeWithoutResponse(keepAliveCommand);
}

// Data timeout monitoring
resetDataTimeout() {
  this.dataTimeoutTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    this.tryRestartStreaming();
  }, 10000);
}
```

### Button State Management
```javascript
// Periodic state reset
const buttonStateReset = setInterval(() => {
  if (!isConnected) {
    setIsDisconnecting(false);
    setIsTogglingRecording(false);
    setIsConnecting(false);
  }
}, 5000);
```

### Device Recovery
```javascript
// Device reset sequence
async tryDeviceReset() {
  await this.stopStreaming();
  // Send multiple reset commands
  for (const command of ['STOP', 'RESET', 'INIT', 'RESTART']) {
    await this.sendCommand(command);
  }
  // Send binary reset commands
  await this.startStreaming();
}
```

## Expected Results

1. **More Stable Connections**: Device should stay connected longer with keep-alive mechanism
2. **Responsive Buttons**: Buttons should always be responsive and reset properly on disconnect
3. **Better Recovery**: App should automatically recover from constant data and connection issues
4. **Faster Failure Detection**: Connection issues detected and handled more quickly
5. **Automatic Restart**: Data streaming automatically restarts if it stops

## Monitoring and Debugging

The improvements include enhanced logging to monitor:
- Connection stability with keep-alive success/failure
- Button state transitions
- Data timeout events
- Recovery attempts and their success
- Device reset operations

## Files Modified

1. **services/BluetoothService.js**:
   - Added keep-alive mechanism
   - Added data timeout monitoring
   - Enhanced device reset capabilities
   - Improved connection monitoring

2. **screens/DashboardScreen.js**:
   - Added periodic button state reset
   - Enhanced disconnect handling
   - Multiple state reset attempts

All modifications maintain backward compatibility and add robust error handling.
