# üîÑ Post-Reload Connection Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide helps verify the enhanced post-reload connection system that addresses BLE connection issues after Metro hot reloads.

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Fresh App Start (Baseline)**
1. **Close the app completely** (swipe away from recent apps)
2. **Launch app fresh** from launcher
3. **Check debug panel**: "Post-Reload Mode: Inactive" (gray text)
4. **Connect to BrainLink device** using device selection
5. **Verify**: Connection should work normally
6. **Result**: ‚úÖ Baseline functionality confirmed

### **Scenario 2: Metro Hot Reload Test**
1. **Start with app running and device connected**
2. **Make a code change** (add a comment or space)
3. **Save file to trigger Metro reload**
4. **Check debug panel**: "Post-Reload Mode: ACTIVE" (orange bold text)
5. **Observe connection behavior**:
   - Should detect existing connection OR
   - Should use enhanced 3-second recovery timeout
   - Should perform BLE stack reset if needed
6. **Try manual reconnection** if needed
7. **Result**: ‚úÖ Post-reload connection restored

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Reload Stress Test**
1. **Start with connected device**
2. **Perform 3-5 consecutive Metro reloads** (save multiple times)
3. **Check each reload**: 
   - Post-reload indicator should show ACTIVE
   - Connection should be restored automatically or with single manual tap
4. **Result**: ‚úÖ Stable connection across multiple reloads

### **Scenario 4: Manual BLE Reset Test**
1. **Get into disconnected state** (any method)
2. **Tap "Force BLE Reset" button** in UI
3. **Wait 2-3 seconds**
4. **Try device connection**
5. **Result**: ‚úÖ Manual reset enables fresh connection

## üîç Debug Information to Monitor

### **Connection Status Panel**
- **Post-Reload Mode**: Should show ACTIVE (orange) after Metro reload
- **SDK Initialized**: Should remain Yes after reload
- **Connection Status**: Watch for state transitions
- **Device**: Should restore device name if previously connected

### **Console Log Patterns**
Look for these key log messages:

#### **Post-Reload Detection**
```
üîç POST-RELOAD: Metro reload detected via multiple indicators
üîç POST-RELOAD: Checking for existing device connections...
```

#### **Connection Restoration**
```
‚úÖ POST-RELOAD: Found connected BrainLink device, restoring connection state...
üì± Restored device info: [device object]
‚úÖ POST-RELOAD: Connection state restored successfully
```

#### **Enhanced Recovery**
```
üîÑ POST-RELOAD: Connection lost after Metro reload - initiating enhanced recovery...
üîÑ POST-RELOAD: Starting BLE stack reset and reconnection...
‚úÖ POST-RELOAD: BLE stack reset complete
```

#### **Manual Connection Enhancement**
```
üîÑ POST-RELOAD: Preparing BLE stack for new connection...
‚úÖ POST-RELOAD: BLE stack reset for clean connection
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **If Post-Reload Mode Not Detected**
- Check if `__DEV__` mode is enabled
- Verify Metro bundler is running
- Look for React DevTools in development

### **If Connection Still Fails After Reload**
1. **Use "Force BLE Reset" button**
2. **Wait 3-5 seconds**
3. **Manually select device from list**
4. **Check device proximity and battery**

### **If Multiple Devices Appear**
- BrainLink devices are filtered automatically
- Device with "BrainLink" or "Macrotellect" in name preferred
- Use device selection UI to pick specific device

## üìä Success Criteria

### **‚úÖ Baseline Requirements**
- Fresh app start connects normally
- Device selection UI works
- Manual BLE reset functions

### **‚úÖ Enhanced Post-Reload Features**
- Post-reload detection indicator works
- Connection state restoration after reload
- 3-second enhanced recovery timeout
- Automatic BLE stack reset for post-reload scenarios
- Manual connection with pre-connection BLE reset

### **‚úÖ Stability Requirements**
- Survives 5+ consecutive Metro reloads
- No permanent connection loss after development sessions
- Manual recovery always available via UI buttons

## üéØ Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Multi-Layer Post-Reload Detection**: Metro, DevTools, navigation type
2. **Connection State Restoration**: Automatic recovery of existing connections
3. **Context-Aware Recovery**: Different strategies for post-reload vs normal scenarios
4. **Enhanced Manual Connection**: BLE reset preparation for clean connections
5. **Visual Feedback**: Post-reload mode indicator and enhanced debug info
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms and manual override options
