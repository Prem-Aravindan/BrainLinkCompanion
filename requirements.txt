# BrainLinkCompanion - Python requirements
#
# This file lists the core Python packages used by the project and
# provides a straightforward way for other developers to create a
# reproducible virtual environment for development and packaging.
#
# Quick start (Windows PowerShell):
#  python -m venv .venv
#  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
#  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Quick start (macOS / Linux):
#  python3 -m venv .venv
#  source .venv/bin/activate
#  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Notes:
# - Versions are pinned to provide reproducible installs across machines.
# - Some packages (PyInstaller, pyserial) are required for packaging and
#   interacting with the BrainLink device. If you only plan to run the
#   GUI in development, you can omit PyInstaller but it's included here
#   because the repository contains packaging scripts.
# - On Windows, run PowerShell as Administrator if you encounter permission errors.

# Core numerical / scientific
numpy==1.28.5
scipy==1.11.4

# Networking / HTTP

# Platform-specific notes (not interpreted by pip):
# - On Windows, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools if you need to
#   compile packages from source. Many wheels are available, however.
# - If you prefer only PySide6 (not PyQt6), remove PyQt6 from the list above.
# - If packaging to a single executable, make sure to build inside a clean
#   virtual environment that matches your target Python version.
